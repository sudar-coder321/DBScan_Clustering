# DBScan_Clustering

### In this Notebook ,  DBSCAN algorithm has been used for clustering. It is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It is used for clusters of high density. It automatically predicts the outliers and removes it. It is better than hierarchical and k-means clustering algorithm. It makes the clusters based on the parameters like epsilon,min points and noise.It separately predicts the core points, border points and outliers efficiently.
